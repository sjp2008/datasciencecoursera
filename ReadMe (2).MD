### Overview
This project serves to demonstrate the downloading and cleaning of a tidy data set that can be used for subsequent analysis. A full description of the data used in this project can be found at:

### Before using or modifying the R script
Once you have obtained and unzipped the data source files, make sure to set the path of the working directory in R to reflect the location of the data source filesin your own directory.

### Project Summary
The following is a summary description of the project instructions

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following: 
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

### Additional Information
You can find additional information about the variables, data and transformations in the CodeBook.MD file.
